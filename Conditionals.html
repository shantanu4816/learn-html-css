        Conditionals
	</p>
</font>

<font size="5">
    <p>
        Java uses boolean variables to evaluate conditions. The boolean values true and false are returned when an 
        expression is compared or evaluated. For example:
        <br><br>
        <img src="java14.png" alt="xyz" height="200" width="1290"> <br><br>
        Of course we don't normally assign a conditional expression to a boolean. Normally, we just use the short version:
        <br><br>
        <img src="java15.png" alt="xyz" height="200" width="1290"> <br><br>
        Boolean operators <br>
        There aren't that many operators to use in conditional statements and most of them are pretty straight forward: 
        <br><br>
        <img src="java16.png" alt="xyz" height="400" width="1290"> <br><br>
        if - else and between <br>
        The if, else statement in Java is pretty simple. <br><br>
        <img src="java17.png" alt="xyz" height="150" width="1290"> <br><br>
        And we can also add an else statement after an if, to do something if the condition is not true
        <br><br>
        <img src="java18.png" alt="xyz" height="180" width="1290"> <br><br>
        The if - else statements doesn't have to be in several lines with {}, if can be used in one line, or without the {}, 
        for a single line statment.
        <br><br>
        <img src="java19.png" alt="xyz" height="150" width="1290"> <br><br>
        Although this method might be useful for making your code shorter by using fewer lines, we strongly recommend for 
        beginners not to use this short version of statements and to always use the full version with {}. This goes to every 
        statement that can be shorted to a single line (for, while, etc).
        <br><br>
        The ugly side of if <br>
        There is a another way to write a one line if - else statement by using the operator ? :
        <br><br>
        <img src="java20.png" alt="xyz" height="350" width="1290"> <br><br>
        Again, we strongly recommend for beginners not to use this version of if.
        <br><br>
        = = and equals <br>
        The operator = = works a bit different on objects than on primitives. When we are using objects and want to check if they are equal, the operator == will say if they are the same, if you want to check if they are logically equal, you should use the equals method on the object. For example:
        <br><br>
        <img src="java21.png" alt="xyz" height="300" width="1290"> <br><br>
