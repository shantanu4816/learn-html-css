        Functions
	</p>
</font>

<font size="5">
    <p>
        In Java, all function definitions must be inside classes. We also call functions methods. Let's look at an example method
        <br><br>
        <img src="java33.png" alt="xyz" height="150" width="1290"> <br><br>
        foo is a method we defined in class Main. Notice a few things about foo.
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                static means this method belongs to the class Main and not to a specific instance of Main. Which means we can call 
                the method from a different class like that Main.foo().
            </li>
            <li>
                void means this method doesn't return a value. Methods can return a single value in Java and it has to be 
                defined in the method declaration. However, you can use return by itself to exit the method.
            </li>
            <li>
                This method doesn't get any arguments, but of course Java methods can get arguments as we'll see further on.
            </li>
        </ul>

        Arguments
    </p>
</font>

<font>
    <p>
        I always like to say that arguments to Java methods are passed by value, although some might disagree with my choice of words, I find it the best way to explain and understand how it works exactly.
        <br><br>
        By value means that arguments are copied when the method runs. Let's look at an example.
        <br><br>
        <img src="java34.png" alt="xyz" height="150" width="1290"> <br><br>
        Here is a another place in the code, where bar is called
        <br><br>
        <img src="java35.png" alt="xyz" height="150" width="1290"> <br><br>
        You can picture in your head that when bar(a, b) is run, it's like in the beginning of bar the following two lines are written:
        <br><br>
        <img src="java36.png" alt="xyz" height="150" width="1290"> <br><br>
        And only then the rest of the method is run.
        <br><br>
        This means that a value get copied to num1 and b value get copied to num2. Changing the values of num1 and num2 
        will not affect a and b.
        <br><br>
        If the arguments were objects, the rules remain the same, but it acts a bit differently. Here is a an example:
        <br><br>
        <img src="java37.png" alt="xyz" height="150" width="1290"> <br><br>
        And here is how we use it
        <br><br>
        <img src="java38.png" alt="xyz" height="150" width="1290"> <br><br>
        Again we can picture the same two lines in the beginning of bar2
        <br><br>
        <img src="java39.png" alt="xyz" height="150" width="1290"> <br><br>
        But when we assign objects, it's a bit different than assigning primitives. s1 and joe are two different 
        references to the same object. s1 == joe is true. This means that running methods on s1 will change the object joe. But if we'll change the value of s1 as a reference, it will not affect the reference joe.

        Non static methods
    </p>
</font>

<font size="5">
    <p>
        Non static methods in Java are used more than static methods. Those methods can only be run on objects and not on 
        the whole class.
        <br><br>
        Non static methods can access and alter the field of the object.
        <img src="java41.png" alt="xyz" height="250" width="1290"> <br><br>

        Calling the methods will require an object of type Student.
        <br><br>

<ul>
    Summary
    <li>
        Every Java method has to be within a class
    </li>
    <li>
        Static methods belong to a class while non-static methods belong to objects
    </li>
    <li>
        All parameters to functions are passed by value, primitives content is copied, while objects are not copied and 
        some would say 'passed by reference'
    </li>
</ul>
